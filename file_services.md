This policy establishes a set of standards designed to ensure that PC users may save designated amounts of data on their workstations; data that is properly stored, maintained, and protected. 

Transparent folder resources are assigned to all workstation users – via File Share Resource Manager (FSRM) – allowing users to save up to 2GB of data on their PCs. This data, in turn, is housed on a storage cluster that is maintained and safeguarded by the Systems Administration Group.

File services allow the Systems Administration Group to manage the growth of data on servers and ensure the efficient use of space. File services, therefore, must be in place to control and forecast growth, audit file storage, and ensure file storage compliance with company security requirements. Without this component, hard drive storage might be consumed.

## Policy Statement
The *File Services* policy identifies the requirements that must be satisfied to ensure efficient file management of data stored on user PCs and workstations.
## Terms
The following terms are specific to the *File Services* policy:

| **Term**                            | **Description**                                        |
| ------------------------------------| -------------------------------------------------------|
| File Share Resource Manager (FSRM)  | Backend software used by the Systems Administration Group to manage files and monitor hard drive storage. |
| Information Security Officer (ISO)  | Team member charged with developing, implementing, enforcing, and maintaining IT security standards for all data systems, thus ensuring there are no breaches and all information and patient data remain safeguarded. The ISO has a range of other responsibilities, such as performing audits, investigating security incidents, evaluating IT risks, and determining IT security policy and strategy. |
| Systems Administration Group       | Under Technical Service Operations (TSO), this team is responsible for the management and oversight of storage devices, servers, and data centers. Daily responsibilities include (but are not limited to) resolving system errors, replacing parts, and reloading operating systems while also ensuring all data is protected and secure. Spelling out this team name is intentional. The team should not be confused with the Systems Assurance Group with the same acronym. |
| Systems Assurance Group (SAG)       | Under Technical Service Operations (TSO), this team reviews all hardware and software installations to ensure that each meets existing standards and that there is a formulated project plan in place prior to any installation. In brief, SAG ensures reliable, efficient, and compliant hardware and software installations. |
| Technical Service Operations (TSO)  | Department that supports the organization by maintaining daily IT operations. In addition, TSO enforces Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards to ensure all company data centers are secure work environments, while also making certain that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) security requirements are satisfied. |

## Scope
The procedures stipulated in this document define file service requirements.

Workstation users may save documents such as MS Office 365 files and Google Workspace documents, for example. These documents may reside as standalone files on the desktop or in the PC folder structure. Unbeknownst to users, the Systems Administration Group uses File Share Resource Manager (FSRM) as a backend solution to manage these documents. With FSRM, the Systems Administration Group can establish pre-designated storage amounts (2GB per user, for instance) to limit the storage space for PC users. By restricting storage, the Systems Administration Group can manage space and prevent hard drive consumption. With approximately 7,500 workstation users, this storage must be managed to ensure efficient use of space and prevent over-consumption.

## Procedures
This section describes the current file management configuration for user PCs and workstations. The information referenced below must comply with the *File Services* policy, requirements that exist to ensure safe and efficient file management.

File services allow the Systems Administration Group to manage the growth of data on servers and ensure the efficient use of space. File services, therefore, must be in place to control and forecast growth, audit file storage, and ensure file storage compliance with company security requirements.

The current (and pre-designated) default quota for space on each company user PC is 2GB, which is suitable for approximately 98% of the 7,500 users – as most users consume less than 1GB. The remaining 2% of the users (exceptions) have been allocated 5GB of file storage. With both restrictions (2GB and 5GB), the system automatically sends an email notification to users when they reach 90% of their space quota. At 100%, users may no longer write/save data.

User files along with the associated server reside in a storage cluster. FSRM is a software solution that allows the Systems Administration Group (from the backend) to manage documents and files. With FSRM in place along with file storage restrictions, the Systems Administration Group can manage files to ensure that there is no space over-consumption. Equally as important, since the Systems Administration Group manages this data, the user files are more efficiently safeguarded.

### Exceptions
Exception requests or permission to deviate from any of the above-referenced procedures/requirements must be submitted to SAG via completion of the *Systems Administration Change of Policy Request* form. This form is available on the corporate SharePoint site, and a copy may be emailed to users who are unable to access this document on the network.

The completed *Systems Administration Change of Policy Request* form must contain signature approval from a Supervisor, Manager, Director, or Executive associated with the department from which the request originates. Upon form receipt, SAG will review the request. Exceptions that are granted will require the signed approval of all SAG members. Actions involving changes to the IT security standards also will require additional approval of the ISO. For example, a change in an Active Directory policy (which is security-related) would require this additional approval.

Exceptions requests cannot be submitted by telephone or word-of-mouth, as these are unacceptable means of request submission.

SAG meets on alternate Tuesdays. For unique situations (where approval is required before the next scheduled meeting), group members may initiate a special meeting.

**NOTE**:
If the request meets the compliance standards referenced in this document, the modification may be authorized by SAG. The approximate timeframe from the point the request is initiated to the actual approval/disapproval is 10 business days (for most requests) or as many as 30 days for more complex requests. If the request is rejected, SAG will provide an explanation which will include the restriction (operational/corporate/local/state/federal) that prevents request approval.

## Forms
Exceptions requests (or permission to violate any of the above-referenced procedures/requirements) must be submitted to SAG via completion of the *Systems Administration Change of Policy Request* form. This form is available on the corporate SharePoint site, and a copy may be emailed to users unable to access this document on the network. 

## Responsibilities
The implementation of this policy rests largely in the hands of members of the Systems Administration Group; however, all **Redacted** employees, contractors (to include persons or companies), and third-party entities/associates who perform work in the data centers in any capacity must comply with this policy.   

## Enforcement
To ensure compliance, TSO and ISO are responsible for enforcing this policy.
The Director of TSO and the Manager of the Systems Administration Group will verify compliance to this policy through various methods including periodic walk-throughs, video monitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and feedback to the policy owner.

All systems will be scanned at regular intervals to determine compliance of patch management. Any item found noncompliant will require immediate remediation.

Users in violation of this policy may lose their privileges to network access as explained in the *Corporate Compliance* document and the *Employee Handbook*; in addition, failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary actions to include job termination.
