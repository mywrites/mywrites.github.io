The Medical Device is designed to detect human genetic diseases via an automated molecular diagnostic system, using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for DNA amplification and High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis for DNA detection.

The Medical Device is intended for Research Use Only and is not to be used in diagnostic procedures.

## Overview
This Instructions for Use (IFU) document serves as an informational guide to help you understand the operation and use of the priming station. The priming station prepares cartridges for use. 

## Instructions for Use
To use and operate the priming station properly, follow the steps documented below.
1. Press the **Power** button at the rear of the device to turn on the priming station.
    
    The screen illuminates, the system boots, and the screen displays a **System Ready** message.
    The remaining priming station user functions specific to equipment operation are touch-screen only, as there are no other buttons on this device.
1. Remove the cartridge from its packaging, wearing disposable gloves and holding the cartridge by its edges.
1. Inspect the cartridge, ensuring it visibly looks intact and the heat sink remains attached to the cartridge.

1. Place a waste well membrane [PART NUMBER REMOVED] on the cartridge to be primed, using the membrane alignment tool [PART NUMBER REMOVED] if necessary.
1. Use/lift the handle to open the priming cartridge lid.
1. Place the cartridge on the nest with the black heat sink facing downward, as depicted in the image below.
1. Press the **Done** button.
1. Add DI water (approximately five (5) ml) to the water reservoir fill line, pressing the **Done** button again upon completion.
1. Close the lid.
1. Press the **Begin** button to start the priming process.
    
    The priming process begins. Priming process duration is approximately 23 minutes. Upon completion, the **Priming Complete** message displays on the touch-screen.

1. Open the lid, carefully removing the cartridge.
1. Close the lid.
1. Press the **Cartridge Removed** button.
    
    The system automatically begins the priming station water removal process, which takes approximately five (5) minutes. Upon completion of the water removal process, the system automatically begins the priming station drying process. This process takes approximately twenty (20) minutes.
1. Retrieve the freshly primed cartridge recently removed from the priming station, while the priming station water removal and drying processes take place.
1. Inspect the cartridge thoroughly to ensure the cartridge waste well and vent well troughs contain water. 
1. Remove the water carefully (and without touching the sippers) using a pipette, if water exists in the cartridge sipper wells.
1. Remove excess water from all cartridge vent and waste wells using a pipette.
    
    Following this cartridge inspection, the cartridge is ready for use.
1. Press the **Prime Another Cartridge** button to perform this action when priming multiple cartridges, for example. 
    
    The **System Ready** message appears, indication that the system is ready to prime another cartridge. You also may press the **Prime Another Cartridge** button during the 20-minute priming station drying process, interrupting this operation to prime additional cartridges.
1. Press the **Power** button at the rear of the device to shut down the priming station.
