**CONTEXT**: I created six user guides for Synadia's distributed systems/communications solution: NATS. Applications, IoT devices, and cloud-based services use the NATS product for secure, fast, and efficient message exchange, even when these entities are spread across different computers or data centers. For example, NATS provides functionality that alerts you when the air pressure in your tires is low. Tracking systems integrated with NATS can provide product order notifications. NATS can ensure your refrigerator temperatures enters energy-saving mode at night. Yes, that's NATS!

The Synadia Cloud user guides, which accompany the Walkthrough [videos](https://docs.synadia.com/cloud/walkthrough), explore the dashboard and provide setup instructions. You can leverage this insight to configure your environment.

## Prerequisites
1. [Synadia Cloud Sign-up](https://cloud.synadia.com./)
1. NATS CLI installation

    Access [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nats-io/natscli/releases): Scroll to **Assets** (click **Show All**) and choose appropriate OS zip file, such as **linux-amd64.zip** or **windows-amd64.zip**

    **Recommendation**: Unzip and save file content in its own nats-cli folder.

1. Cluster of NATS servers

    Our default system is available.

1. [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) installation (Windows users only)

## Overview
Five user guides accompany the Synadia Cloud Walkthrough [videos](https://docs.synadia.com/cloud/walkthrough):

1. [Synadia Cloud Overview](https://docs.synadia.com/cloud/user-guides/sc-overview)
1. [Connection Graph](https://docs.synadia.com/cloud/user-guides/connection-graph)
1. [User Management](https://docs.synadia.com/cloud/user-guides/user-mgmt)
1. [JetStream Management](https://docs.synadia.com/cloud/user-guides/jetstream-mgmt)
1. [Cross-Account Sharing](https://docs.synadia.com/cloud/user-guides/cross-acct-share)

## Quick Start Workflow

![Workflow](/img/syn_qs1.png)

## System
After Synadia Cloud Sign-up, you access the dashboard.

![Dashboard](/img/syn_qs_dash2.png)

To access a system:

Click **NGS**.

This document, as with all user guides, uses the **Personal/Free** tier. This tier includes two accounts; one is a **Default**, which you can modify.

![Default Account](/img/syn_qs_default_acct3.png)

## Account
Accounts allow you to allocate resources and commonly include business functions (Order, Purchase, Ship) or reflect DEV/TEST/PROD environments. The accounts you create will depend on your use case. In our example, we add an account specific to an app that manages orders: **Cloud_Acct**.

To create an account:

1. Click either of the two **Create Account** options.
1. Designate your account parameters to include an **Account Name**.

    There is no need to focus on the parameters at this point. You can make edits later.

1. **Save** your updates.

    **Create Account** becomes disabled and unavailable for selection, as you now have two accounts in use.

    ![Create Account Disabled](/img/syn_qs_acct_disabled.png)

## User
Users are commonly apps, devices, or microservices. The users you create will depend on your use case. In our example, the user is an app: **cloud**.

To create a user:

1. Click your new app account, **Cloud_Acct**.
1. Click the **Users** tab.

   ![Cloud Account](/img/syn_qs_cloudacct1.png)

1. Click **Create User**.
1. Designate your user parameters.
1. **Save** your updates.

   The table displays the user you created.
   
   ![Cloud Account](/img/syn_qs_cloudacct2.png)

1. Click your new user from the **Name** column.

    The **Overview** window opens. There are no **Active Connections** or **Subscriptions**. There is also no **Recent Activity**. **Get Connected** appears near the top right of the window.

    ![Overview No Data](/img/syn_qs_overview_no_data6.png)

## Connection
**For new users**: Step 1 in the **Get Connected** window referenced below requires that you download a **Credentials** file. Save this file in your **nats-cli** folder, created as a prerequisite. If you did not create the **nats-cli** folder, save the **Credentials** file in the same folder as your **nats-cli**. You might also prefer to use environment variables.

**For new Windows/PowerShell users**: Step 2 in the **Get Connected** window requires that you copy a command statement. We recommend that you paste this command into Notepad++ (or similar editor), remove the backslash "\" separators, and use the **Backspace** key to ensure this statement appears on one continuous line. Equally as important, ".\" precedes this command (and others that you enter in your terminal). **An example appears further below**.

**For new Linux users**: In general, use a forward slash "/" as opposed to a backslash "\" when executing commands.

To establish a connection:

1. Click **Get Connected**.

    A window by the same name opens, providing connection access via **CLI**, **MQTT**, or **HTTP** Gateway. For this **Quick Start Guide**, use **CLI** (default).

    ![Get Connected Cloud User](/img/syn_qs_getconnect7.png)

1. **Step 1: Download Credentials**

    We have downloaded and saved the file at:

    C:\Synadia_Software\nats-cli

1. **Step 2: Create NATS context**

    The context contains:

    **SYSTEM-ACCOUNT NAME-USER**

    In our example, the context appears as **NGS-Cloud_Acct-cloud**; **NGS** is our System, **Cloud-Acct** is our Account Name, and **cloud** is our User.

1. Copy the code then paste into your terminal.

    We recommend that new Windows/PowerShell users follow the instructions specified in the Note above. Also, leaving one or more spaces between sections of the command statement (as shown below) does not impact execution.

    Example:

    .\nats context save --select "NGS-Cloud_Acct-cloud"  --server "tls://connect.ngs.global"  --creds   C:\Synadia_Software\nats-cli\NGS-Cloud_Acct-cloud.creds

    ![Get Connected Cloud User Connect OK](/img/syn_qs_connectok8.png)

    The **Connection: OK** terminal message appears.

1. **Step 3: Connect to NATS server** by executing the command:

    .\nats sub ">"

    ![Cloud User NATS Sub](/img/syn_qs_subscribeon9.png)

    **Subscribing on >** confirms communication.

1. Return to the UI, click **Done** to exit **Get Connected**, and **Refresh** the now open **Overview** window to view data in **Active Connections**, **Subscriptions**, and **Recent Activity**.

    ![Cloud User Overview with Data](/img/syn_qs_overviewdata9.png)

1. Click the **Connections** tab.

    The **Connections** tab also displays data.

   ![Connection Graph](/img/syn_qs_connect.graph11.png)

You have acquired Synadia Cloud provisioned and authenticated credentials, which are used to connect to the NATS server. More specifically, when you created a user, you downloaded a **Credentials** file that allowed your Synadia Cloud user to authenticate with the NATS server. We have specific tools available, such as the NATS Go Client, that allow you to connect to the NATS server by embedding this code within your app/device/microservice (user). This applies if your app, for example, is coded in Go. Similarly, if your app/device/microservice (user) is coded in Python or JavaScript, youâ€™ll use the Python Client or JavaScript Client, respectively, to connect to the NATS server. We also support C, C#, Java, .NET, and Rust.

Next, we recommend that you read the [Synadia Cloud Overview User Guide](https://docs.synadia.com/cloud/user-guides/sc-overview).
