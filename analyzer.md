* Maximize the **Medical Device Software Login** screen and enter login credentials.
* Select the **Run** tab.
* Enter a **Run Name**.
* Select a **Panel**.
* Enter data in the **Well Plate ID** field.
* Load consumables, ensuring that each is placed into the DNA Analyzer in the correct orientation.
* Close drawer.
* Start **Run Initialization**.
* Remove consumables (after Run completion) and dispose per company protocol.
* Analyze data.
* Turn off system components.

After the Run completes, you must properly dispose of consumables per your company protocol. All consumables are single-use only and can be disposed of in municipal waste receptacles.
