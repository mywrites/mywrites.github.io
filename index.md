Writing is my passion. 

From the high school yearbook staff to college publications . . . <br/>
From writing for various news outlets to proposal writing . . . <br/>
From computer programming courses to technical writing . . . <br/>

I am a writer by trade and at heart.

For all documents in my portal, I performed in-depth research (reading existing content and other collateral), viewed instructional videos, and navigated applications â€“ leveraging these efforts to independently understand software solutions. When necessary, I also collaborated with subject matter experts to confirm my understanding. 

I am intentional and user-focused when I write. My goal is to educate, which enables engineers, customers (technical and non-technical), and stakeholders to gain tremendous insight. I find gratitude in creating clear and concise content, particularly when users voice appreciation for finally understanding software functionality, technical concepts, or workflows.

While I have abbreviated or redacted portal content to protect proprietary information, the majority of my work is fully available for review. This portal showcases my writing range, style, and expertise.

If you are seeking a meticulous and reliable writer with 100% on-time documentation delivery, look no further!
