## QMS Purpose
This Quality Management System (QMS) manual defines policies and procedures that are implemented to ensure all products and services meet customer and regulatory requirements specific to medical devices and related services. This manual details the company approach to quality and demonstrates conformance to ANSI/AAMI/ISO 13485:2003/(R)2009, Part 820 - Quality System Regulation and Canada Medical Device Regulation SOR 98-282. ISO 13485 indicates QMS requirements for medical device design, production, and maintenance, ensuring products are safe and effective. The document purpose, therefore, is to define the QMS, communicate its Quality Policy, and demonstrate regulatory compliance to the aforementioned standards.

## General Requirements
The QMS processes are monitored, measured for effectiveness, and managed with consistency and oversight. The company exercises a commitment and responsibility to quality via employee training, adherence to procedures, a focus on customer satisfaction, and continuous process improvement. The QMS is managed by a select Senior Management team with a designated point-person (Management Representative) who further ensures QMS compliance in accordance with the specified standards. Company products include medical devices (with both hardware and software components) and chemical reagents.

## Customers
External customers include consumers, pharmacies, and health care networks along with private and governmental health bodies. Other customers include:
* Clinics
* Hospitals
* Physician's Offices
* Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)
* Diagnostic Testing Facilities
* Company Subsidiaries/Business Units

## QMS Documentation Hierarchy
The QMS documentation hierarchy is inclusive of three primary levels:
* Level 1 Global QMS Procedures – Procedures developed to ensure that activities impacting quality have been identified. 
* Level 2 Work Instructions – Organizational documents or instructions provided to ensure effective planning, operation, and process control.
* Level 3 Records – Records and other documents required by the regulatory requirements.

## Document Control
This component ensures that there is a document review and approval process, which involves circulation of this document to designated Senior Management personnel. This team reviews the document and, ultimately, approves all content. This team also is responsible for document updates and revisions. The QMS document control procedures, therefore, address document review, approval, update, and revision (to include the date, time and signature associated with these changes); in addition, these procedures address the timeframe that documents will be retained. An electronic copy of the QMS is stored on the network and available to authorized personnel. Records and other materials compiled during the creation of the documented QMS are maintained on hardcopy and soft copy for a specified timeframe.

## Quality Policy
Management's commitment to quality is evidenced in the actual language of the Quality Policy, its ability to monitor related processes, the practice of measuring process effectiveness, and the emphasis on continuous improvement. Management further demonstrates commitment through management reviews, performance metrics, and communication with all employees. Management, therefore, defines and communicates the Quality Policy throughout the organization; in addition, management ensures resources are in place to maintain the integrity of the QMS.

The QMS manual review and approval process involves circulation of this document to designated Senior Management personnel. This team reviews this document and, ultimately, approves all content. This team also is responsible for document updates and revisions to include the date, time, and signature associated with document changes.

To monitor QMS performance, our company conducts customer surveys and measures complaints as a means of determining the pulse of customers. Management ensures that the appropriate course of action is taken based on customer feedback, and the results of these activities are documented in the Management Reviews.

Senior Management defines and communicates the quality policy. This policy is reinforced via signage throughout the facility and echoed during employee training sessions and orientation sessions for new hires. Senior Management reviews the Quality Policy regularly to ensure that it remains appropriate and consistent with regulatory requirements. These reviews along with any subsequent changes or revisions are documented during review meetings.

Management defines, reviews, and communicates quality objectives; in addition, specific team members are designated to ensure that each objective is achieved. Objectives are communicated, allowing individuals within the organization to contribute to their achievement. Objectives are reviewed regularly by Senior Management and can be revised as needed. Management maintains the QMS via an organized system of reviews, approvals, and when needed, changes. All activity is documented during Management Reviews, and the validity of the QMS is maintained through this process and oversight.

The chart and table below provide the high-level leadership roles that are directly related to the responsibility, authority and communication of the QMS.

REDACTED

Senior Management ensures that communication within the organization is timely and effective by conducting Management Reviews, periodic employee meetings, and regularly scheduled staff meetings along with posted bulletins and the distribution of a comapany-sponsored newsletter. Senior Management provides internal communication to ensure that the Quality Policy is effectively echoed throughout the organization. This communication extends itself to the proper design and production of the medical device. Senior Management review input includes customer feedback (via surveys, for example), audits, process improvement recommendations, and action items from previous Senior Management review meetings.

To ensure that the facility and workspaces conform to the QMS relative to Quality Policy and objectives, specific internal company divisions are charged with maintaining facility grounds, the communications system, computer network, and employee work areas. Through management reviews, this compliance is monitored and adjusted as required.

To ensure that the work environment or conditions do not negatively impact the product, regular reviews and inspections are required (and performed) as to conform with regulatory requirements. Safety measures also are in place specific to the health, cleanliness, and clothing to ensure QMS compliance.

## Security
All visitors must report to the main gate/building where they sign a guest register and are issued a badge (or name tag). While on the premises, personal property (cars, purses, backpacks) are subject to inspection. When exiting the site, the badge (or name tag) must be returned.

The Emergency Action Plan must be followed during fires, spills of hazardous materials, medical emergencies, or other incidents requiring emergency intervention. Employees and consultants are made aware of the Emergency Action Plan during their orientations, and designated Safety Officers are in place to ensure proper implementation. Employees and consultants are made aware of the names and locations of the Safety Officers, and they also have their respective contact telephone numbers.

When alarms, horns, and/or strobes are signaled, the building is evacuated immediately. All occupants must leave the building, using the nearest exit and proceeding to the appropriate assembly area. Area emergency evacuation representatives conduct roll calls to account for the whereabouts of all team members. Visitors must remain with their representative and proceed to the assembly area where they remain until the representative gives the all-clear to re-enter the facility.

## PPE
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is required in specified areas of the site along with safety shoes; in addition, certain forms of hearing protection and protective clothing and safety glasses with side shields are required, contingent upon the activity/operation.

## Product Realization Planning
The QMS documents the processes used to develop, manufacture, and deliver medical device products and services such that all procedures are compliant with the aforementioned standards and regulatory requirements. Our team also ensures contractual requirements are satisfied, and agreements and customer orders comply with regulatory requirements.

## Design and Development Planning
Design Control & Commercialization (DCC) Guidelines describe the controlled process by which new products and services are designed and commercialized. This process includes activities to control and verify the design of a product to ensure specific design requirements are satisfied. Records such as reports, requirements, and input documents are generated and maintained as defined within the DCC.
