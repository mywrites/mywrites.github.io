# PURPOSE OF POLICY
This policy establishes a set of requirements designed to standardize application delivery methods; more specifically, this policy ensures there is a consistent, efficient, and secure method in place for moving applications from servers to user workstations. Citrix, located on the desktop, is the mechanism servers use to deliver applications â€“ using the product: XenApp. The XenApp software allows the operation of all of our company's medical applications. The XenApp software, not visible to users, allows Citrix Administrators to access the application to troubleshoot issues. The Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop technologies are the primary methods for delivering applications to user workstations.

## POLICY STATEMENT
The *Citrix XenApp* policy identifies the requirements that must be satisfied to provide standard application delivery to user workstations.

## PROCEDURES
The procedures delineated below must be followed to comply with the Citrix XenApp policy for data centers.
1. IT must provide a supported, current, and stable Windows XenApp server that meets the hardware and software requirements from the application vendor.
1. IT support must require that any vendor application be compatible with a supported version of XenApp, Windows OS, and all components within the OS such that they meet IT application and security standards. In addition, as versions of the XenApp and Windows server operating systems become outdated and unsupported, IT support must have assurances, in writing, that a technical roadmap exists for upgrades and configuration changes for 5-year vendor support of any Citrix resource published in the Citrix environment.
1. All hardware attached to Citrix servers or workstations (using a Citrix receiver or resource) must, before deployment, be listed on the current Citrix/Windows/VMware compatibility matrix, which is available online. Attached hardware not on these compatibility matrices will not be supported in the Citrix environment.
1. Administrative/root access to Citrix infrastructure devices (such as Server OS, Citrix Admin Console, and NetScaler) is not allowed without written approval from the Systems Assurance Group (SAG).
1. IT support will provide and maintain necessary backups and/or snapshots of these servers as a basic recovery plan. Detailed backup requirements from each vendor must be provided to ensure adequate recovery methods exist at Mock Company ABC, as to recover any Citrix resource defined by Mock Company ABC Recovery Point Objective (RPO)/Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirements.
